    <p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HISTORY</p>
    <p>The project began in late 2013, and has passed beyond its first phase (2014), in which we planned the input model and had the KU Leuven LIBIS team configure the open source software Collective Access to our needs; and its second phase (2015), with the development and launching of the website, created with the open source platform Omeka. Much attention was paid to the development of a search engine that would yield the best result: the Catalogue Search was configured with the Solr advanced search engine in combination with a SQL based field search. This guarantees maximal flexibility in searching and high accuracy in search results.</p>
    <p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CURRENT (general):</p>
    <p>The project has now entered its third stage (2016-), focusing on metadata input and writing up the paraphrases. At present <strong>2727</strong> archival texts are available on the <em>NaBuCCo</em> website, and more will be uploaded from our database within the coming months.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, a comprehensive up-to-date Neo-Babylonian bibliography with <strong>4782</strong> individual entries is currently ready available on the <em>NaBuCCo</em> website.</p>
    <p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CURRENT (in detail):</p>
    <p>Melanie Gro&szlig; has worked on <strong>the Early Neo-Babylonian documentation</strong>, which roughly dates to a period from 721 BCE to 626 BCE. It almost exclusively comprises legal records mainly from the reigns of the Chaldean Marduk-apla-iddina (721-710) and the Assyrian kings Esarhaddon (680-672), &Scaron;ama&scaron;-&scaron;umu-ukīn (667-648) and Kandalānu (647-627).&nbsp; The corpus counts over 700 tablets from which almost 400 texts are published. Due to the lack of any publication, over 200 texts are only presented along with their basic metadata according to the catalogues Brinkman and Kenney, JCS 35 and JCS 38. From the total of more than 700 texts over <strong>500</strong> are currently available on <em>NaBuCCo</em>. The majority of the texts stem from the cities Babylon, Borsippa, Dilbat, Nippur and Uruk, but Early Neo-Babylonian records were also found in Sippar, Ki&scaron; and Ur. About one quarter of the material can be assigned to a private archive, including the archives of &Scaron;umāya from the Nappāhu family and Bēl-u&scaron;allim from the Lē&rsquo;ēa family in Babylon, the archives of Bēl-ēṭer of the &Scaron;ang&ucirc;-Dilbat family and of L&acirc;bā&scaron;i, son of Nādinu, as well as the archive of Marduk-&scaron;āpik-zēri of the Egibi family in Dilbat, the archive of Ninurta-uballiṭ, son of Bēl-usāti, in Nippur and the archive of Mu&scaron;ēzib-Marduk of the S&icirc;n-nāṣir family in Uruk. Smaller numbers of tablets belong to the archives of Bēl-ēṭir of the Miṣirāya family in Ki&scaron; and the archive of Upāqu, son of Nab&ucirc;-uṣalli, in Dilbat. Furthermore, the archive of the &Scaron;am&scaron;ēa family in Uruk contains some Early Neo-Babylonian legal records, which go back to Nab&ucirc;-u&scaron;allim, the first of three generations. A small number of Early Neo-Babylonian documents belong to the large archive of the Eanna Temple in Uruk, which principally dates to the Neo-Babylonian period and later. While text editions are provided in various different publications, the work on these texts has been much facilitated by Nielsen 2011 and Nielsen 2015.</p>
    <p><strong>The documentary sources from Babylon</strong> are being dealt with under the scientific guidance of Kathleen Abraham (KU Leuven) and Michael Jursa (University of Vienna).</p>
    <p>Kathleen Abraham with the assistance of Stefania Ermidoro and Evelien Vanderstraeten has worked on the <strong>archive of the family of Egibi (and its Nūr-S&icirc;n annex</strong>), the largest private archive from first millennium Babylonia. Of the about 1,600 tablets having been identified as belonging to it, <strong>1417</strong> are currently available on <em>NaBuCCo</em>. The majority of the tablets is in the British Museum; other museums and collections hold comparatively smaller groups. The Egibi archive is a family archive spanning five generations of entrepreneurs, covering a period from the late reign of Napopolassar (626-605) until shortly after the reign of Darius (522-486). The chief actors (and archive holders) are all offspring of a single male line: &Scaron;ulāya, his son Nab&ucirc;-ahhē-iddin, his son Itti-Marduk-balāṭu, his son Marduk-nāṣir-apli and his son Nidinti-Bel. The third generation, Itti-Marduk-balāṭu, was married to <sup>f</sup>Nuptāya, the daughter of Iddin-Marduk, son of Iqī&scaron;āya of the Nūr-S&icirc;n family and to <sup>f</sup>Ina-Esagila-ram&acirc;t of the Nabāya family. This connection brought about that part of the archive of the Nūr-S&icirc;n family was found with the Egibi family archive. Central publications for the Egibi archive are Strassmaier's handcopies (1885-1897) as well as the full editions in Abraham 2004 (144 texts), Wunsch 1993 (387 texts, Nūr-S&icirc;n annex) and Wunsch 2000 (240 texts).</p>
    <p>M. Jursa, with the assistance of Matthias Adelhofer, has worked on the second largest known private archive from Babylon, the <strong>Nappāhu archive</strong>, with its <strong>291&nbsp;</strong>tablets (including 25 duplicates). The archive covers a period from the late reign of Nebucchadnezzar (604-562) to the first years of Xerxes (485-465). It primarily records the activities of Iddin-Nab&ucirc; and his son &Scaron;ellibi of the Nappāhu family who were personnel of the I&scaron;hara Temple. The archive has been published by Baker 2004.</p>
    <p><strong>The documentary sources from Borsippa</strong>: Melanie Gro&szlig; dealt with <strong>the archive of the families Ea-ilūtu-bāni, Ilī-bāni and Nanāhu in Borsippa</strong>, which were related through marriage. It comprises <strong>318</strong> business documents (including duplicates) of altogether six generations and covers the long period from the Assyrian king A&scaron;&scaron;ur-nādin-&scaron;umi (699-694) to the Persian king Xerxes (485-465). The majority of the texts have been published in Joann&egrave;s 1989 and some fifty more texts are still unpublished.</p>
    <p><strong>The documentary sources from Nippur</strong>, and first and foremost the Mura&scaron;&ucirc; family's business archive with its<strong> 758 </strong>texts is currently in preparation.</p>
    <p><strong>The documentary sources from Sippar</strong> are currently in preparation. Melanie Gro&szlig; already entered the <strong>197</strong> texts (including duplicates) of <strong>the Ṣāhit-gin&ecirc; A archive in Sippar</strong> which</p>
    <p>have recently been published in Waerzeggers 2014. The archive contains the business documents of three generations, namely Bēl-uballiṭ, his son Marduk-rēmanni and his grandson Bēl-bullissu who have been active from the reign of Nabonidus (555-539) to the reign of the Persian king Xerxes. The <strong>&Scaron;ang&ucirc;-&Scaron;ama&scaron; A</strong> archive (a.k.a Bēl-remanni) published by Jursa 1999 (135 texts) is currently in preparation (Matthias Adelhofer and Elad Aaron) and will soon be available.</p>
    <p><strong>The documentary sources from Uruk</strong> are being dealt with under the scientific guidance of Michael Jursa (University of Vienna) and Shai Gordin (Ariel University / Tel Aviv University) &ndash; for full information please refer to the project page <a href="http://nabucco.arts.kuleuven.be/uruk/">here</a>. The following is just a brief summary of the archives that are being made available. Matthias Adelhofer, assistant to the project, entered the 24 texts of the <strong>N</strong><strong>ūr-S&icirc;n archive</strong>. The remaining private archives from Uruk will be made available on the platform in the near future. For the meanwhile detailed summaries of the archives of Rīm-Anu, Nur-S&icirc;n, Kurī C, Bēl-aplu-uṣur (= Bēl-sup&ecirc;-muḫur), Ekur-zakir, Gimil-Nanāya B, and Ubaru can already be found <a href="http://nabucco.arts.kuleuven.be/nabucco/uruk_archives">here</a>.<a id="_anchor_4" name="_msoanchor_4" href="file:///C:/Users/Hans/Dropbox/Egibi%20FMPRO/WEBSITE%20planning/ABOUT/Nabucco_ABOUT%20and%20NEWS%20(USE_THIS_ONE)_June%202017.docx#_msocom_4"></a></p>
    <p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FUTURE:</p>
    <p>In 2017, the <em>NaBuCCo</em>-team plans expanding the text Catalogue, keep the bibliography update, and adjust some of the display features on the website in order to enhance user-friendliness.</p>
    <p><em>NaBuCCo</em> is currently expanding to include transliterations (in searchable text) and photos through cooperation with CDLI and ACHEMENET.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The NEWS feature on the website's homepage will keep you updated on our progress.</p>
    <p>Along with the text catalogue and bibliography (data input and upload), we envision an interlinked 1<sup>st</sup> Millennium BC Babylon Portal which will provide profound information about history, topography and geography, economy, society and culture of Babylonia, to be developed in subsequent years. This tool aims to help the non-specialist user to set the original textual sources in context and understand their background. While the basic outline of the portal and a few entries have been prepared, more time (and funding) is needed to complete a substantial part of it.</p>
